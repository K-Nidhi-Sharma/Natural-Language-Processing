    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    " Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the ability to identify the meaning of words in context in a computational manner. It is a trending area of research in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. WSD is basically solution to the ambiguity which arises due to different meaning of words in different context. \n",
    "For example, consider the following sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "    •\tI need to pass the bar exam to become a lawyer\n",
    "\n",
    "    •\tI am going to eat the energy bar every morning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The word bar in the first sentence refers to the bar council of India and in the second sentence, it refers to an eating item. The ambiguity that arises due to this, is tough for a machine to detect and resolve. Detection of ambiguity is the first issue and resolving it and displaying the correct output is the second issue.\n"
